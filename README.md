# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Indonesia-OSN-SQL
## Objective
This project demonstrates how data analysis, backed by SQL queries, can reveal meaningful insights into educational trends and achievements. By uncovering these trends, I aim to show the power of data analysis in understanding the performance and demographics of students in Indonesiaâ€™s National Science Olympiad.
## Key Steps in the Process:
1. Data Import and Preparation
I started by obtaining the OSN dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anakpindahan/indonesia-national-science-olympiad-osn). The data was in CSV format, which I imported into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin. After creating the database and corresponding tables, I ensured that the column names matched the CSV file structure to successfully load the data.
2. Exploratory Analysis & Queries
After importing the data, I used SQL queries to derive insights from the dataset. A few key queries include
3. Exploring Insights & Visualizations
After exploring core questions like trends in participation, medal distribution, gender distribution, and performance across provinces and subjects. These insights were then visualized using Power BI to make the findings more accessible.
