## Objective
This project showcases how data analysis can uncover valuable insights into educational trends and achievements. By analyzing the dataset, I aim to highlight the role of data in understanding the performance and demographics of participants in Indonesiaâ€™s National Science Olympiad (OSN).

## Key Steps in the Process
1. Data Collection and Preparation\
I began by obtaining the OSN dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anakpindahan/indonesia-national-science-olympiad-osn), available in CSV format. Using pgAdmin, I imported the data into PostgreSQL, designed a database schema, and created tables with column names aligned to the dataset structure to ensure a smooth import process.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
After importing the data, I performed exploratory analysis using SQL. This step involved designing and running queries to uncover key insights about participation trends, medal distributions, gender representation, and performance across provinces and subjects.

3. Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation\
Following the EDA, I extracted the data and visualized them in an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard includes multiple pages to showcase participants, medals, subjects, adn province, making the findings easily understandable and actionable.
